Speed Dating Analysis
Explore a dataset stemming from a speed dating experiment conducted between 2002 and 2004. During these events, participants engaged in brief "first dates" with each member of the opposite sex. Subsequently, they had to decide whether they wanted to see their date again and were tasked with rating their date based on six attributes:

Physical Attractiveness
Sincerity
Intelligence
Enjoyment
Ambition
Shared Interests
The dataset also encompasses questionnaire responses collected from participants at various stages of the process.

The notebook should encompass the following components:

Summary Statistics
Data Visualizations
Captions and interpretations elucidating the relevance of these components to why individuals consent (or do not consent) to a second date.
Libraries utilized: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
