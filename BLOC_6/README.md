Objective: Simplify the job search process in the field of data by presenting job listings that are tailored to skills, regardless of job titles. This will involve employing text processing methods and clustering techniques to group job descriptions based on the required skills, software, and programming languages.

Data will be collected from various job posting websites using web scraping tools, followed by thorough data cleaning prior to modeling.

Additionally, an interactive Streamlit application will be developed to provide a deeper insight into the data job market, describe the clusters, and explore job listings processed by the model.

This project was realised with two other people : Fran√ßois and Pauline

Key Libraries Utilized: scrapy, pandas, numpy, plotly, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, streamlit.
