        Hello ! ðŸ‘‹  
        With this dashboard you will discover some good informations about GetAround app !  
        When people rent a car they have to follow few steps like checkin at the beginning and checkout at the end of the rent. To help users with theses steps,  
        GetAround offers two solutions :   
        Mobile ðŸ“± : when driver and owner meet and sign the rental agreement of the owner's smartphone  
        Connect ðŸ›œ : when the driver doesn't meet the owner, everything is done with the application created by GetAround  
        This dashboard answers two questions :   
        - What threshold should be set to limit the impact of delays?
        - This threshold should be enable on all cars ? Or only Connect cars ?""")

st.markdown("""We can easily observe a great decrease in impacted cases around 100 minutes of delay and inversely for the solved cases. Thanks to this data we can estimate that a threshold between 90 and 120 minutes between two reservations is the best solutions to limit the impact of delays from previous reservation and optimize the flow between owners and drivers.  
            Mobile and Connect checkin seems to have the same behaviour so the feature can be implemented on both checkin type. However, the Connect method has a smaller sample size and may be interesting for initial testing.""")
