Embark on the creation of an automated spam detection system capable of swiftly identifying and flagging spam messages based exclusively on their SMS content. The dataset at our disposal comprises messages categorized as "spams" and "hams." Noteworthy is the dataset's relatively modest size, consisting of 5,566 lines.

Key Deliverables:

A comprehensive notebook encompassing all essential preprocessing steps.
One or more Deep Learning models meticulously designed to predict whether messages are spam or ham.
A transparent presentation of the attained model performance metrics.

Libraries Employed: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tensorflow, Sickit-learn
